# Iris Flower Classification
### A basic ML classification project based on the iris flower dataset
<p>This is one of the earliest datasets used in the literature on classification methods and widely used in statistics and machine learning.  The data set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a type of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the latter are not linearly separable from each other. The data set is compiled by Ronald Fisher, a biologist, in the 1930s.</p>
<p>This dataset is made of 4 features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.</p>
<p>This is an exceedingly simple classification project and targetted for beginner level. Most simplest ML algorithms can easily achieve 100% accuracy on this datset.</p>
